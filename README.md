## Setup

First of all, I recommend you to use the arcolinuxb openbox iso to use these dotfiles. If you want to download it, it's available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arcolinux-community-editions/files/openbox/).

### 1. Update the system

Before you start, make sure your system is up to date.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

### 2. Clone the repository and restore the dotfiles

To use these dotfiles, I encourage you to clone this repository like bare repository.

```bash
cd ~
git clone --bare git@github.com:aluissp/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

To make it easier to work with the dotfiles, you can define an alias in your shell configuration file.
Open `.bashrc` and add the following line:

```bash
alias dotfiles="git --git-dir $HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree $HOME"
```

After that, reboot your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

Now you can use the `dotfiles` alias to manage your dotfiles. To restore the dotfiles, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotfiles checkout -f --
```

Once you have restored the dotfiles, reboot your system to apply the changes.

### 3. Install the required packages

To install the required packages, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed - < .pkgs
for x in $(< .aur-pkgs); do yay -S $x; done
```

### 4. Git & fish

You can customize the git prompt and activate fish shell.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh \
&& mv git-prompt.sh .git-prompt.sh

chmod +x git-prompt.sh
./git-prompt.sh

sudo chsh $USER -s /usr/bin/fish
```

### 5. Activate nvidia hybrid graphics

If you have nvidia graphics, you'll notice that there're `optimus-manager-qt` and `optimus-manager` installed. First, you need comment the following lines in `/etc/sddm.conf`:

```bash
# DisplayCommand=/usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsetup
# DisplayStopCommand=/usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xstop
```

After that, reboot your system and open the `optimus-manager-qt` to activate the hybrid graphics.
To apply the changes, reboot your system again.
If you have any problem, you can check the [official documentation](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager?tab=readme-ov-file#kde)

### 6. Work with multiple monitors

If you have multiple monitors, you can use the `arandr` tool, simply run it and save the configuration like `~/.screenlayout/monitor.sh`. After that, reboot your system to apply the changes.

### 7. Install the themes and icons

There're many themes and icons that you can see [here](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/). However, the themes and icons that I use are the following:

- Cursor: Bivata-Modern-Ice
- Theme: [Orchis-Dark](https://www.pling.com/p/1357889/)
- Icons: [Tela-dark](https://www.pling.com/p/1279924/)

Once you have downloaded, use the following commands to install them:

```bash
cd /usr/share/themes/
sudo mv ~/Descargas/Orchis.tar.xz .
sudo tar -xvf Orchis.tar.xz

cd /usr/share/icons/
sudo mv ~/Descargas/01-Tela.tar.xz .
sudo tar -xvf 01-Tela.tar.xz
```

Finally, you can use the `lxappearance` tool to apply the changes. Remember to reboot your system to apply the changes.

### 8. Wallpapers

By default there're some wallpapers. However, you can download more from [here](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/Wallpapers.git)
Or you can clone with git and use the nitrogen tool to apply the changes.

```bash
cd ImÃ¡genes
git clone https://github.com/antoniosarosi/Wallpapers.git
nitrogen
```

### 9. Grub

There's a amazing tool to customize the grub. The `Grub Customizer` helps you to change the background, the colors, the fonts, etc. Open rofi and type `Grub Customizer` to open it.

### 10. SDDM

SDDM is a nice display manager. You can customize it using the `ArcoLinux Tweak Tool`. Open rofi and type `Tweak Tool` to open it. I've applied the theme `sugar-candy`. If you want to change the background, open the configuration file `/usr/share/sddm/themes/Sugar-Candy/theme.conf`. And set the background like this:

```bash
# change this
Background="/usr/share/backgrounds/archlinux-login-backgrounds/att-05.jpg"
```

## Keybindings

There's common keybindings that you can use:
| Key | Action |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **mod + j** | next window (down) |
| **mod + k** | next window (up) |
| **mod + shift + h** | decrease master |
| **mod + shift + l** | increase master |
| **mod + shift + j** | move window down |
| **mod + shift + k** | move window up |
| **mod + shift + f** | toggle floating |
| **mod + tab** | change layout |
| **mod + [1-9]** | Switch to workspace N (1-9) |
| **mod + shift + [1-9]** | Send Window to workspace N (1-9) |
| **mod + period** | Focus next monitor |
| **mod + comma** | Focus previous monitor |
| **mod + w** | kill window |
